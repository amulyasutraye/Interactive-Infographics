            <p>One study of over 1 million people showed that those who exercised three to five times per week for 30 minutes or more had a 35% lower risk for developing depression than those who didn’t exercise at all. Exercise also increases levels of endorphins – hormones associated with improved mood – which could explain why it helps improve mental health.</p>

            <p>The global market for meditation and mental wellness apps reached over 533 million U.S. dollars in 2022. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of these apps, with Calm and Headspace leading the market and generating significant revenue. While adoption rates have dropped, the growing global demand for mental health support and awareness is expected to drive further development in the meditation app market.</p>

            <p>This meta-analysis provides a comprehensive review of randomised trials examining the effects of an exercise training program on sleep quality in middle-aged and older adults with sleep complaints including insomnia, depression, and poor sleep quality. These findings demonstrate that the participants did not sleep for a longer duration after participation in exercise training but they nevertheless perceived better sleep quality. </p>

They also said that the platforms exacerbated anxiety and depression, deprived them of sleep, exposed them to bullying and created worries about their body image and “FOMO” (“fear of missing out”). </p>
